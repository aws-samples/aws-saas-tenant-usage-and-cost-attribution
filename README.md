# Cost Visibility and Usage Attribution in Multi-Tenant SaaS Environments

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers are constantly striving for cost and usage awareness across their users, tenants, features, and tiers. Understanding and optimizing the cost of running these various units inside your SaaS workload (users/tenants/features/tiers) is paramount for driving profitability and sustaining growth.

This workshop aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to calculate and visualize your unit cost within a SaaS environment. While the approaches we will discuss apply to any type of unit, the focus here will be on the “cost per tenant”, which is the most common concern we see for SaaS providers operating their SaaS solutions on AWS.
